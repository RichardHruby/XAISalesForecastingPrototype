# XAISalesForecastingPrototype
This repository contains a prototype explanation interface for sales forecasting AI. The prototype builds on preliminary result from the first iteration of a Design Science Research Project. It proves the technical feasibility of the proposed design concepts, but it is not yet evaluated. The design and the prototype will be iteratively improved in the upcoming design-and-evaluate cycles through the integration of expert and user feedback.
